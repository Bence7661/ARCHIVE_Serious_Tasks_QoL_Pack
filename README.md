# Tasks QoL Pack
[BETA] - This is mainly because of **PDA Taskboard Fix**  

A modpack consisting of my task related QoL mods.  
I decided to bundle together 3 of my mods because all depend on each other. If need be I can eliminate the dependency, but for now I just release it as a pack instead.

# Disclaimer
**PDA Taskboard Fix** Needs some more testing. Especially with iTheon tasks.
So far I got good results hence why I dare to share this mod(pack) with you guys.

# Contents
- **The Job Can Wait**
- **The Northern Job**
- **PDA Taskboard Fix** (Only available within this pack)

# Installation instructions
If you have any of these enabled: **The Job Can Wait**, **The Northern Job** disable them.
Drop this mod at highest priority as it overwrites a lot of files.

# Compatibility
Manual patching needed
- New levels 0.53 (2023.07.25): Patch can be found in `gamedata\compatibility_patches\New_Levels_0.53`. There is a `README.txt` with instructions on how to apply (You just need to drag and drop 1 file no biggie).
- If you've disabled `G.A.M.M.A. Psy Fields in the North`. There is a folder in `gamedata\compatibility_patches` called `You disabled - G.A.M.M.A. Psy Fields in the North`. Check readme and install.

# MCM Options
- Standalone **The Job Can Wait** had MCM options. These can still be found under MCM -> **The Job Can Wait**.
